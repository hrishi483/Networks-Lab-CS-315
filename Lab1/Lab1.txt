Task1:
(i)ping www.google.com is used to test the reachability of host and also get the RTT. Low values of the RTT and loss percentage indicates that the connection is successful.
Other information includes IP address google (142.250.183.228). Size of packets 56(84) bytes of data.
The ttl and the RTT time for each packet.
The statistics of each packet
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 33.657/36.255/83.894/5.248 ms

(ii)traceroute is command that is used to trace the route that your router takes from local machine to the ww.google.com.
Indicates total number of Hops and also Hop information(hop number, IP address and hostname of router, RTT values)

(iii)arp: Relationship between IP and MAC address for devices on network. Includes Address: IP address , HWType: hardware type, HWaddress: MAC address corresponding to IP address, Flags:Indicate success of the arp cache entry, Mask: Network Mask, Iface: Network entry used (ethernet,Wlan)

(iv)ifconfig:

(v)hostname: Gives information about hostname

(vi)
/etc/hostname: Displays the hostname stored in machine.

Task2:
1)hostname: Using hostname
ip address using ifconfig and selecting from eth0->inet 

2)Next hop is the gateway. Whenever we use traceroute www.website.com
the ip address of first hop is the the same. This is the IP Address of First Hop :172.29.80.1
Mac address:00:15:5d:85:63:39 obtained by using arp command

3)To get the DNS address of local server 172.29.80.1 this is stored in /etc/resolv.conf file

4) protocol names and their numeric representations for communication between networked device, appears in IP header.

5) Using the services file we can get this information
ssh             22/tcp 
ftp             21/tcp
nfs             2049/tcp
nfs             2049/udp


Task3
(i)
--- www.iitb.ac.in ping statistics ---
93 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 95674ms

--- www.amazon.in ping statistics ---
12 packets transmitted, 12 received, 0% packet loss, time 11134ms
Observations:there is an issue with reaching www.iitb.ac.in, resulting in packet loss, while www.amazon.in is reachable without any packet loss.
The absence of RTT values for www.iitb.ac.in indicates that there was no successful communication during the ping test.


(ii)
(a) Total Number of Hops = 5
traceroute to www.amazon.in (18.66.55.107), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
1  ****.mshome.net (172.29.80.1)  3.020 ms  2.969 ms  2.952 ms
 2  10.196.3.250 (10.196.3.250)  4.062 ms  4.044 ms  4.267 ms
 3  10.240.0.1 (10.240.0.1)  4.232 ms  4.212 ms  3.662 ms
 4  10.240.240.1 (10.240.240.1)  3.814 ms  3.796 ms  3.780 ms
 5  117.205.73.161 (117.205.73.161)  5.077 ms  5.061 ms  5.047 ms
 6  * * *
 7  * * *
 8  * * *

-->the IP address after www.amazon.in indicates the IP address of destination with 30 max Hops and packet of size 60
-->The * indicates there is network congestion or high packet loss.
-->If the final Hop shows the destination hostname/IP address we can conclude that destination is reached.
-->The -w option allows you to specify the time to wait for a response from each hop. If the response time exceeds this value, the packet is considered lost.

Hop Map
(172.29.80.1)->(10.196.3.250)->(10.240.0.1)->(10.240.240.1)->(117.205.73.161)

(b)Using traceroute -m <max_hops> www.amazon.in we can change the maximum hops.

(c) At each router 3 packets are delivered and the three columns indicate the RTT time for those.
In order to change the number of packets sent
use traceroute -q <new_packet_numebr> ww.amazon.com

(d)The TTL field is important in case of icmp so that the packets are not stuck in infinite loop, discarding the out-of-Date Packets and also helps in aiding the network diagonistics.
